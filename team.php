             <p> Spices, Regardless of what scent or flavour they add to a dish, thereys one thing that they all have in common:
              their shape. From ginger to pepper, from tamarind to dal, every ingredient we know of either come as a circle or is chutneyto be served
            in a well rounded form. This logo takes its inspiration from this unique shape.</p>
